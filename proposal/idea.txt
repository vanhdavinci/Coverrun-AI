Jargon AI: Intelligent Financial Management for Jargon AI

Solutions Introduction 
Jargon AI: Intelligent Finance AI Agent
Jargon AI is an AI financial planning product specifically designed for Jargon AI. It is intended for supporting citizens of Vietnam toward financial strength and wealth through a sophisticated, personalized, and smart way toward managing money. Unlike the traditional fixed-jar-based approach, the Jargon AI actively divides the monthly income, actively predicts spending patterns, provides personalized recommendations, and complements the services provided by Jargon AI, offering a fully flexible and user-centric financial planning service.
Main Features
Jargon AI's core functions are rooted in some of the most sophisticated AI methods, providing an efficient and hassle-free financial administration process.
1.	Predictive & Dynamic Jar Allocation
We recommend replacing the conventional "6-Jar" rigid percentage allocations with an adaptive model. This flexible model recognizes the fact that rigid percentages rarely are appropriate for the broad incomes, life stages, and spending priorities of distinct users.
How Allocation Works:
Allocation by Jargon AI is factor-based and real-time, aiming to make specific financial recommendations.
•	User Cohort: Different user groups (e.g., young professionals, families, retirees) have distinct financial needs.

•	Major Data Covered: Complete data acquisition results in appropriate forecasting and recommendations.

•	Allocation Drivers: These are those specific pieces of information through which funds are allocated from one jar to another.
New User Onboarding:
For first-time users, Jargon AI provides a speedy and personalized setup:
•	Quick-Start Goal Wizard: Guides the user through setting first financial goals.

•	Demographic Quiz: Gathers basic information like income, age, location, and interests to personalize first recommendations.

•	Specific Objectives: Users can specifically state their financial objectives (e.g., "Save ₫50 Million for postgraduate study").

•	Recommended Safety Buffer: Estimates personalized safety net based on area cost of living for financial stability.
Established User Optimization:
•	Jargon AI continuously improves allocations for current users by taking into account past performance and new trends.

•	Past Cash-Flow Trends: examines historical revenue and expenses to comprehend normal financial trends.

•	Jar-by-Jar Spending Discipline: Evaluates users' compliance with their jar spending plans.

•	Finding trends in non-essential spending is known as "trending discretionary spend."

•	Seasonality: Takes into consideration predictable changes in costs, such as increased summer utility bills and back-to-school costs.

•	Predictive Alerts for Future Large Payments: Informs users ahead of time of major expected costs.
An example of a scenario:
User Situation: Due to Vietnam's hot summers, users typically spend 20% more on electricity. AI Reaction: Jargon AI automatically takes this pattern into account and raises the "Necessity Jar" by roughly 5–10% throughout these months.


2.	Intelligent Transaction Classification & Advice
Jargon AI's program constantly observes and categorises all user transactions automatically into the six financial jars. This real-time sorting, with the assistance of several input mechanisms, provides instant financial advice and actionable proposals, allowing the user to be current with their expenditure.
How it Works:

Automated Categorisation: Each transaction is automatically allocated to the most relevant jar (Necessity, Play, Education, Investment, Charity, Savings) based on the descriptions and the metadata.

 In-Moment Spending Guidance: If the customer is going over budget, the system provides real-time recommendations.
Sub-feature: Graph-Based Bill Recognition
Jargon AI will have the capability of enabling the users automatically classify transactions simply by taking a photo of their receipts or bills. This function makes the expenditure tracking convenient and efficient with flawless financial categorization.
Functionality
•	You can upload or capture photos of paper bills and receipts.

•	The program pulls pertinent details of the transactions like the date, merchant name, details of purchases, and total amount.

•	These automatically captured details are then categorized in the appropriate financial jar.


Advantages: Reduced time for the entry of information by hand, improved accuracy of tracked spending, and a general review of all expenses.
Techniques of Image-Based Recognition:
•	Optical Character Recognition (OCR): For converting text images into machine-readable information.

•	Computer Vision (CV) & Machine Learning: For the extraction of meaningful information from the varied bill formats (e.g., layout recognition, key-value pair extraction).


Example Scenario:

 Transaction Example: "10.000₫ for Grocery payment" → This transaction goes to the Necessity Jar, and the corresponding fund is deducted.

 Situation Example: A user has over-spent their "Play Jar" budget by 25% by the middle of the month.
 AI Response: Jargon AI notifies the user immediately:
 "You've over-spent your 'Play Jar' budget by 25% during the course of the month. Consider reducing discretionary spending during the remainder of the month or transferring a moderate amount from your 'Savings Jar' if urgent. I can give some ideas about money-saving activities?"
Methods for Classification:

 Natural Language Processing (NLP):
•	BERT-based models (Sentence Transformers or fine-tuned DistilBERT): These powerful models are deployed for the purpose of automatically classifying and categorizing transactions into respective jars based upon metadata and transaction descriptions, identifying the semantic meaning of the text.

•	LLM with formatted JSON result: Advanced Large Language Models are not only usable for classification, but also for producing formatted results enabling richer interpretations of transactions.
3.	AI Agent Chatbot – Instant 24/7 Virtual Support
Imagine having a friendly financial companion at your fingertips—ready to chat, offer advice, and even handle the nitty-gritty of your money management whenever you need it. That’s our AI Agent Chatbot: a 24/7 virtual support system that feels like texting a savvy friend about your finances.
What it does for you
•	Keeps your “jars” in shape. If you’re following the popular “jar” method of dividing your money—Necessities, Education, Play, etc.—our chatbot can instantly move funds between jars or adjust balances on the fly.

•	Logs every purchase. Spent 10.000₫ on a bottle of water? Just tell the chatbot, and it records the transaction, updating the right jar automatically.

•	Looks back so you can move forward. Wondering why your Necessity Jar ballooned this month? The bot digs into your recent transactions and points out patterns (like that seasonal electricity bump), so you understand exactly what’s happening.

•	Helps you plan big goals. Whether it’s a new laptop in four months or an emergency fund, the system assesses your current habits, suggests budget tweaks, and lays out a clear savings roadmap.


A Day in the Life of Your Chatbot
1.	You: “Hey, I spent 10.000₫ on water today.”
 Chatbot: Logs it under Necessities and adjusts your jar balance.


2.	You: “Why did my Necessity Jar go up by 10% this month?”
 Chatbot: “I checked your transactions—your electricity bills jumped 20% in December. I automatically nudged your Necessity Jar to cover it, so you didn’t have to scramble.”


3.	You: “Move 10,000,000₫ or 10% from Necessities to Education.”
 Chatbot: Transfers the funds instantly.


4.	You: “I want a 30,000,000₫ laptop in four months. Can I do it?”
 Chatbot: “Based on your spending patterns, you can—but it’ll take some tweaks. If you dial back Play Jar fun by 1,500,000₫ each month and reallocate 6,000,000₫ from your Savings Jar now, you’re on track. I can also show you extra spots to trim—like those little café splurges. Want a detailed breakdown?”


How It Works (Behind the Scenes)
•	Conversational AI. Our language model understands your questions and adapts its tone to feel approachable and clear.

•	Smart orchestration. When you ask something, the chatbot decides which tools to call—whether it’s updating a jar, fetching transaction history, spotting trends, or building a savings plan.

•	Real-time insights. By blending your own data with smart analyses (and even external knowledge when needed), the chatbot gives you personalized advice that evolves with your habits.

Architecture of Solution 
 
Figure 3: AWS Architecture Diagram of Jargon AI
Here’s the detailed description for each of the numbered components (1–6) in your AWS Architecture Diagram, following your provided structure and system concept:
① Front-End & API Layer (User Interaction & Authentication)
•	Components: Amazon CloudFront, Amazon Cognito, Amazon API Gateway, and React App
•	Description:
This layer serves as the Jargon AI platform's user interface. For optimal performance, users engage with a React frontend that is hosted globally via Amazon CloudFront. User authorization and authentication (such as sign-up, login, and identity management) are managed by Amazon Cognito.
•	After authentication, the Amazon API Gateway connects the React application to backend services, sending secure API requests to AWS Lambda so that business logic can be executed.
② OCR & Document Parsing (Intelligent Bill Capture)
•	Components: Amazon Textract and AWS Lambda
•	Description:
Image-based document recognition is covered in this section. Amazon Textract is triggered by AWS Lambda when users upload bills or receipts, and it uses optical character recognition (OCR) to extract important fields (such as the merchant, date, and amount).
③ Knowledge Base for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
•	Components: Text Embeddings, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base, and Amazon S3
•	Description:
LLM-driven insights and the AI Agent Chatbot are supported in this section. Amazon S3 is where documents like Jargon AI Products and Financial Management Tips are kept.
By converting these documents into text embeddings, a Bedrock Knowledge Base is created that improves chatbot responses through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which incorporates pertinent outside data into user conversations.
④ Amazon Bedrock LLM Agent (Conversational Orchestration)
•	Components: Amazon Bedrock, AWS Lambda
•	Description:
This agent is the main LLM interface that drives financial analysis, real-time conversations, tailored responses, and action execution (such as redistributing jars or examining trends).
AWS Lambda is triggered by incoming user messages, and the Bedrock Agent is then called to process the natural language, produce insights, and call auxiliary services (such as data fetch, goal suggestions, and notifications).
⑤ User Financial Data Management
•	Components: Amazon DynamoDB
•	Description:
Amazon DynamoDB securely stores all user data that is specific to each individual. This comprises: Details about the user profile; Portfolio information; Jar allocations; Past transactions; Monitoring goals
This structured data ensures real-time synchronization between chatbot interactions and user data, supporting both financial analytics and LLM orchestration.
⑥ Predictive Modeling & Insights Layer
•	Components: Amazon Forecast, Amazon Personalize, AWS Glue, S3 Data Lake, Amazon Athena, Amazon Quicksight, and Amazon Pinpoint are among the components.
•	Description: This analytical pipeline offers spending projections, visual insights, and tailored recommendations:
o	Amazon Forecast forecasts future revenue and expenses.
o	Jargon AI product promotions and financial advice are customized by Amazon Personalize.
o	Structured and unstructured data are processed by AWS Glue and stored in a data lake.
o	Historical data querying is made possible by Amazon Athena.
o	Jar usage, spending patterns, and objectives are visualized by Amazon Quicksight.
o	Amazon Pinpoint provides financial warnings (such as overspending and payment reminders), promotional content, and personalized alerts.
